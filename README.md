## About

The **AI Touristic Information Tool for Liquid Galaxy** is a Flutter-based Android tablet application that simplifies and enhances travel planning by helping users discover personalized points of interest worldwide. Whether you're searching for popular tourist attractions, dining options, or shopping locations nearby or across the globe, the app leverages the power of Generative AI through Google‚Äôs Gemma and Gemini models to provide tailored recommendations.

With Liquid Galaxy technology, users can visualize their entire trip across multiple screens, creating an immersive panoramic experience. The app seamlessly synchronizes maps between the Liquid Galaxy rig and the application via Google Maps. Additionally, it can operate as a standalone tool, offering tours and POIs based on AI-generated data.

## Prerequisites 

### Device Compatibility
- The application requires an Android tablet running Android 13 (API level 33) or higher.
- The tablet has to be a 10 inch android tablet.

### Liquid Galaxy Integration (Optional)
- To fully utilize the Liquid Galaxy features, ensure that the Liquid Galaxy core is installed. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Liquid Galaxy repository](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB) and check the [training video done by me](https://youtu.be/jz-QZi__10c?si=SjxrbuDSZQXv6kRl) for more information.

### Gemini API Key
- You can go to the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio) and click on "Get a Gemini API key" to create your own API key.

### Gemma Docker Installation (Optional)
- To run a Docker container for using the Gemma model locally, follow the [Docker guide]().
- Once the container is running, you can interact with the model through the terminal using the following CURL command. Replace "your_input_here" with your desired query:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/rag/stream_events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"input": "your_input_value_here"}'
```

### YouTube API Key:
- You can get your own Youtube API key by following the guide from [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

### Deepgram API Key:
- You can get your own Deepgram API key from [here](https://console.deepgram.com/)

---

## Building From Source:

### General for both Gemma and Gemini

To build the app from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by opening a new terminal and running:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/LG-Gemma-AI-Touristic-info-tool.git
    ```

2. Set up a Google Maps API key:
    - Obtain a Google Maps API Key by following the instructions [here](#link-to-google-maps-api-instructions).
    - Navigate to the `android/app/main` directory within the cloned repository.
    - Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in a text editor.
    - Locate and update the following section where you replace "GMP_KEY" with your own Key:
      ```xml
      <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
          android:value="GMP_Key"/>
      ```

3. Run the application:
    - Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd LG-Gemma-AI-Touristic-info-tool/ai_touristic_info_tool
      ```
    - Install the necessary dependencies:
      ```bash
      flutter pub get
      ```
    - Launch the app:
      ```bash
      flutter run
      ```
> **Important**: Ensure you have a tablet device connected or an Android tablet emulator running before executing the `flutter run` command.

## Using Gemma Instead of Gemini

1. Follow the Docker guide for installation and running the container [here]().

2. If you want to use Gemma instead of Gemini:
    - Switch to the `gemma_app` branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout gemma-app
      ```
    - Configure your IP address and port:
        - For a real device, use your computer's IP address.
        - For an emulator, use `10.0.2.2`.
        - The port should be `8085`.
