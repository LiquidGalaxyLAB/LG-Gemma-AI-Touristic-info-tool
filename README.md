## Building From Source:

### General for both Gemma and Gemini

To build the app from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by opening a new terminal and running:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/LG-Gemma-AI-Touristic-info-tool.git
    ```

2. Set up a Google Maps API key:
    - Obtain a Google Maps API Key by following the instructions [here](#link-to-google-maps-api-instructions).
    - Navigate to the `android/app/main` directory within the cloned repository.
    - Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in a text editor.
    - Locate and update the following section where you replace "GMP_KEY" with your own Key:
      ```xml
      <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
          android:value="GMP_Key"/>
      ```

3. Run the application:
    - Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd LG-Gemma-AI-Touristic-info-tool/ai_touristic_info_tool
      ```
    - Install the necessary dependencies:
      ```bash
      flutter pub get
      ```
    - Launch the app:
      ```bash
      flutter run
      ```
> **Important**: Ensure you have a tablet device connected or an Android tablet emulator running before executing the `flutter run` command.

## Using Gemma Instead of Gemini

1. Follow the Docker guide for installation and running the container [here]().

2. If you want to use Gemma instead of Gemini:
    - Switch to the `gemma_app` branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout gemma-app
      ```
    - Configure your IP address and port:
        - For a real device, use your computer's IP address.
        - For an emulator, use `10.0.2.2`.
        - The port should be `8085`.
